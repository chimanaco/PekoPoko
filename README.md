# PekoPoko

PekoPoko is TouchDesigner playground which I usually use as a visual generator. I customize this with more effects and visuals when I do performance. Pretty much in development.

## Getting Started
Open `PekoPoko.toe`. You might need for seconds to load all .tox. `F1` key will take you to Perfome Mode.

## Features
* Simple visual mixer
* Recording a movie

## Todo
* Add mask layers.
* Add more faders for visual outputs control (transparency, mix, etc).
* Control panel for visuals and effects order. Now they are in `/project1/Visuals/Geometry/LoadingToxes`, `/project1/EffectsL/LoadingToxes` and `/project1/EffectsR/LoadingToxes`.
* Organize UI network.
* Remove duplicated operators for sound reactive in each visuals.
* Improve performance.
